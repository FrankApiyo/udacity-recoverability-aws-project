Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: In the case of a single Availability Zone (AZ) outage, the RTO for a Multi-AZ, multi-region database is typically very low. This is because the database is designed to automatically failover to the standby replica in another AZ within seconds. The failover process is automated and ensures minimal downtime, allowing the database to quickly resume operations without significant interruption.

Minimum RTO for a single region outage: In the event of a complete region outage, where all AZs in a region become unavailable, the RTO can be higher compared to a single AZ outage. The failover process involves promoting the standby replica in another region to become the new primary database. The time required for this failover process can vary depending on factors such as the database size, network latency between regions, and the complexity of the application. However, with proper configuration and automation, the RTO can still be relatively low, ranging from minutes to hours.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) refers to the maximum acceptable data loss in the event of a failure. For a Multi-AZ, multi-region database, the RPO for a single AZ outage is typically very low, often zero. This is because the database uses synchronous replication between AZs, ensuring that data is replicated to the standby replica in real-time. As a result, in the event of an AZ failure, there is minimal to no data loss, and the standby replica can seamlessly take over without any loss of data.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage: In the case of a complete region outage, the RPO can be higher compared to a single AZ outage. This is because the replication between regions is typically asynchronous, introducing some delay in data replication. As a result, there might be a small amount of data loss, typically measured in seconds or minutes, depending on the replication lag between the regions. However, with proper configuration and replication mechanisms, the RPO can still be kept relatively low, ensuring minimal data loss in the event of a region-wide failure.
